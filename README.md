Shelby is a set of objects to quickly build Knockout view models that will handle most of your business cases.

##Building Shelby from sources

If you prefer to build the library yourself:

 1. **Clone the repo from GitHub**

        git clone https://github.com/patricklafrance/shelby.git
        cd shelby

 2. **Acquire build dependencies.** Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your workstation. This is only needed to _build_ Shelby from sources. Shelby itself has no dependency on Node.js once it is built (it works with any server technology or none). Now run:

        npm install -g gulp
        npm install

    The first `npm` command sets up the popular [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build tool. You might need to run this command with `sudo` if you're on Linux or Mac OS X, or in an Administrator command prompt on Windows. The second `npm` command fetches the remaining build dependencies.

 3. **Run the build tool**

        gulp

    Now you'll find the built files in `dist`.

## Running the tests

Build the sources with Gulp and then the specs can be runned in a browser, simply open:

1. test/runner-jquery-1.html
2. test/runner-jquery-2.html
3. test/exports/runner-browserify.html
4. test/exports/runner-requirejs.html
